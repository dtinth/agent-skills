To see available skills and install them, use the [skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI:

```sh
npx skills add dtinth/agent-skills
```

The above command:

- Shows the list of available skills
- Lets you choose which skill(s) to install
- Lets you choose which agent to use it with
- Lets you choose whether to install globally or in the project

## Other Skills

I use these third-party skills:

```
npx skills add microsoft/playwright-cli
```
